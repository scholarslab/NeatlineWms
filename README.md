# Neatline Maps

Neatline Maps allows users to connect items in an Omeka collection to web map services delivered by Geoserver, a powerful open-source geospatial server. Web map services can be linked with items in two ways. If the service already exists, the the WMS address and list of layers can be added directly to the item record in the standard Omeka administrative interface. Or, if you have login access to a Geoserver instance and want to upload a new georeferenced .tiff file, you can point the Omeka installation to the Geoserver and then upload the .tiff file on an item as you would a regular file. Neatline Maps will detect the geoencoded file, create a new coverage store and layer on Geoserver, and link the item to the newly-created WMS by automatically populating the WMS address and layer fields.
